# parcelLab — Returns Portal

## The situation

You're joining the returns team for a day. We run the customer-facing returns portals
for many well-known brands. Customers use them to look up an order, see which items are
eligible for return, and submit a request. You may have used one yourself. The portal is
live, but it's rough around the edges: the previous engineer left before finishing some
critical backend work, tests are failing, and a few things are broken.

Below is the current backlog. The first three tasks (BR-001–003) are required; **you
don't have to do everything else** — pick the electives that best show what you can do,
and explain your choices in `DECISIONS.md`.

> Please do not fork this repository. Clone it directly, work locally, and submit a
> personal repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Codeberg, or send us a zip file.

## Getting started

**Stack:** Python 3.12+, Django, pytest, Ruff, mypy. PyYAML is included if you want it
for rules config.

```bash
uv sync

uv run pytest              # you'll see some failures — that's intentional
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/returns/> and try order `RMA-1001` with email
`alex@example.com` or zip `10115`.

### Project layout

```
portal/
  data/orders_raw.json      # raw order payloads from upstream
  data/                     # your rules config goes here (you define the format)
  services/mapper.py        # maps raw payload → domain model (incomplete)
  services/eligibility.py   # return eligibility evaluator (stubbed)
  templates/returns/*       # Django + HTMX UI
  tests/*                   # pytest suite (some tests intentionally failing)
```

## Ground rules

> **Time limit: 4 hours.** If you hit the limit, stop and submit what you have. We'd
> rather see clean, well-reasoned partial work than a rushed complete solution.

**AI tools** are welcome. If you use them, note which tools you used and what for in
`AI_LOG.md`.

## The backlog

**BR-001, BR-002, and BR-003 are required.** We use those three to compare submissions.
Everything else is an elective: pick one or two, skip the rest, and explain your choices
in `DECISIONS.md`.

### BR-001 · Complete the mapper gaps

Our upstream order system sends detailed payloads, but the mapper was left unfinished —
item-level flags never got wired up. The eligibility engine needs these to make
decisions.

Missing fields on each article:

- `is_digital`
- `is_final_sale`
- `category`

Look at the raw data in `orders_raw.json` and the test fixtures to understand the
different payload shapes you need to handle.

---

### BR-002 · Build the return eligibility engine

Right now, `evaluate_eligibility()` just marks everything as returnable. We need a real
rules engine — one that's configurable, not hardcoded.

Design your own rules format (JSON, YAML, whatever you prefer) and implement the
evaluator. It should return a clear result per item (returnable or not, reason, matched
rule) and handle at least:

- Return window (delivered date + allowed days)
- Already fully returned
- Digital items
- Final-sale items

We intentionally don't provide a rules file — we want to see how you'd structure it.

---

### BR-003 · Fix and extend the test suite

Several tests are failing. Some depend on BR-001 and BR-002 being done, others may have
their own issues. Make the suite green and add tests that give you confidence in your
implementation.

---

### BR-004 · Category-specific return windows

Product just told us that different categories need different return windows.
Electronics should be 14 days, apparel gets 30, and so on. Add per-category window
config to the rules engine and make the evaluator use it. Fall back to the order-level
default when a category isn't configured.

---

### SEC-001 · Security audit

A security researcher has contacted us claiming they can access customer order data they
shouldn't be able to. They want a fee to disclose the details. We'd rather understand
our own exposure.

Audit the portal's **authentication and authorization model** — how a customer proves
who they are, and how the app decides what they're allowed to see. We're not looking for
a single planted bug; we want your assessment of the system.

Produce a short write-up (in `DECISIONS.md` or a `SECURITY.md`) that:

- **Lists the threats you found** — each with a one-line description of how it's
  exploited and what it exposes.
- **Ranks them by real-world exploitability** — not theoretical severity. A trivially
  scriptable attack against live customer data outranks one that needs a session you
  can't get.
- **Fixes the one you judge most important**, with a test that demonstrates the exploit
  before the fix and its absence after.
- **Says why you deprioritized the rest** — what you'd do with another day, and what
  you'd escalate to the team rather than fix solo.

We care more about how you reason about the exposure and where you choose to spend
limited time than about the length of the list.

### FR-001 · Show returnable items only

Support keeps asking: can customers filter the articles list to only see what's actually
returnable? Add a "Show returnable only" toggle using HTMX — no full page reload.

---

### FR-002 · Fix the return submission flow

The "Continue" button on the articles page is dead — the rest of the flow was apparently
deleted before the last push. Build the missing pieces: article selection → confirmation
→ success. A customer should be able to complete a return end-to-end, and a submitted
return must survive a server restart — persist it.

One thing support keeps seeing: impatient customers double-click submit, or hit refresh
on the success page. Decide what should happen in both cases and implement it.

---

### OPEN-001 · Surprise us

If you spot another useful improvement, you can take it on. Keep it small and describe
it in `DECISIONS.md`.

---

## What to submit

- Working, type-safe code
- Small, readable commits
- `DECISIONS.md` — what you picked, what you skipped, and why
- `AI_LOG.md` — if you used AI tools
